Our code simulates the Computer Architecture hardware algorithm developed by Tomasulo (Robert Tomasulo, IBM, 1967). This architecture enhances performance by allowing out-of-order execution of instructions, register renaming in hardware, reservation stations and the Common Data Bus.

Many modern high-performance processors use a derivative of Tomasulo’s architecture for dynamic scheduling.
